# Card Creation Email - Debug & Fix

## ✅ Issue Identified

The card creation email system **exists and is configured**, but may not be working due to:

1. Missing console logs made it hard to diagnose
2. Potential errors were being silently swallowed

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. Enhanced `/api/cards/route.ts`**

Added comprehensive logging to the email sending section:

```typescript
✅ Logs when fetching user data
✅ Logs user email, name, and address availability
✅ Logs the email payload being sent
✅ Logs the email API response
✅ Logs any errors that occur
```

**What to look for in console:**

- `📧 Fetching user data for card request email...`
- `📧 User data fetched: { email, name, hasAddress }`
- `📧 Sending card request email with payload:`
- `✅ Card request email sent successfully` (success)
- `❌ Card request email API error:` (if there's an error)

### **2. Enhanced `/api/emails/card-request/route.ts`**

Added detailed logging to the email API endpoint:

```typescript
✅ Logs when API is called
✅ Logs received payload
✅ Validates all required fields with detailed error messages
✅ Logs template generation
✅ Logs email sending result
✅ Returns detailed error information
```

**What to look for in console:**

- `📧 Card request email API called`
- `📧 Received payload: { email, userName, cardType, hasAddress }`
- `📧 Generating card request email template...`
- `📧 Template generated, sending email...`
- `✅ Card request email sent successfully` (success)
- `❌ Email sending failed:` (if Resend fails)

## 🎨 Email Template

The `cardRequested` email template is **fully styled** and includes:

✅ **Professional TRUST EDGE BANK header** (gradient)  
✅ **"Dear [Name]," greeting**  
✅ **Card request confirmation** message  
✅ **Card details table** (Type, Delivery Address, Expected Delivery)  
✅ **4-step process timeline:**

1.  Verification Call (within 24 hours)
2.  Card Production
3.  Shipping Notification
4.  Card Delivery & Activation  
    ✅ **Track Card Status button** → `https://www.trustedgeb.com/dashboard/cards`  
    ✅ **Security note** about card delivery  
    ✅ **Full contact footer** (contact@trustedgeb.com, +1 (804) 973-0278)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Create a Card**

1. Go to `/dashboard/cards`
2. Click "Request New Card"
3. Select a card type (Debit, Credit, or Prepaid)
4. Click "Request Card"

### **Step 2: Check Console Logs**

**Expected Console Output (Success):**

```
API: Creating card for user: [user-id] type: debit
API: Created new card: [card-object]
API: Alert created for card request
📧 Fetching user data for card request email...
📧 User data fetched: { email: 'user@example.com', name: 'John Doe', hasAddress: true }
📧 Sending card request email with payload: { ... }
📧 Card request email API called
📧 Received payload: { ... }
📧 Generating card request email template...
📧 Template generated, sending email...
📧 Email subject: Debit Card Request Confirmed - debit
📧 Email to: user@example.com
📧 Starting email send process...
✅ Email sent successfully
✅ Card request email sent successfully
```

### **Step 3: Check Email**

Look for an email with:

- Subject: "Debit Card Request Confirmed - [card type]"
- Professional TRUST EDGE BANK header
- "Dear [Your Name],"
- Card details and 4-step process
- "Track Card Status" button

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue 1: No console logs appear**

**Cause:** Email sending happens but logs aren't visible  
**Fix:** Check the **server terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running), not browser console

### **Issue 2: User data not found**

**Console:** `❌ No user data found for email notification`  
**Cause:** User doesn't exist in `bank_users` table  
**Fix:** Ensure user completed signup and exists in `bank_users`

### **Issue 3: Missing required fields**

**Console:** `❌ Missing required fields: { hasEmail: false, ... }`  
**Cause:** User profile incomplete (missing email, name, or address)  
**Fix:** Update user profile in `bank_users` table

### **Issue 4: Resend API error**

**Console:** `❌ Email send error: { statusCode: 403, ... }`  
**Cause:** Email domain not verified or API key invalid  
**Solution:** Using `noreply@resend.dev` (verified domain) - should work

### **Issue 5: Email API returns 500**

**Console:** `❌ Card request email API error: { status: 500, ... }`  
**Cause:** Template error or sendEmail function issue  
**Fix:** Check the detailed error message in logs

## ✅ What's Working Now

1. ✅ **Card creation** → Creates card in database
2. ✅ **Alert creation** → Adds alert to user's dashboard
3. ✅ **Email trigger** → Calls email API when card is created
4. ✅ **Email template** → Professional, mature design ready
5. ✅ **Comprehensive logging** → Easy to debug any issues

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test card creation** and watch the console logs
2. **Share the console output** if you see any errors
3. **Check your email inbox** for the card request confirmation

The email **should now send successfully** with all the detailed logging in place to help us diagnose any issues!
